# Secure-Auth-OTP-Visualizer
Secure-Auth-OTP-Visualizer is a Python project that provides secure password hashing, OTP generation and verification, and visualizes password strength and OTP usage trends. It ensures safe user authentication with bcrypt and pyotp, along with matplotlib visualizations for better security insights.

# Features:
- Password hashing and verification.
- OTP generation and verification.
- Password strength validation.
- Visual representation of OTP usage and password strength.
- Detailed logging of each operation.

# Requirements:
- Python 3.x (required for compatibility with modern Python features)
- bcrypt (for secure password hashing)
- pyotp (for generating and verifying OTPs)
- matplotlib (for visualizing OTP usage and password strength)
